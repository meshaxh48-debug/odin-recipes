    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Lasagna</em> is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years.

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p> 
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p> 
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
    <h4>step 6</h4> 
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4> 
        <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p> 
    <h4>Step 9</h4> 
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 10</h4>
        <p>Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before cutting; this helps it set and firm up.</p>
