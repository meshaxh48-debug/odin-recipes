    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>Fried-Rice</em>is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.</p>
    <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
    <p>If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 4 cups of water and 2 cups of white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat, then cover and simmer until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice for 8 hours (or overnight) before using in this recipe.</p>
